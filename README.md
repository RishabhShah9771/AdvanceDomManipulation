## What is DOM?

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, enabling developers to manipulate its content and structure programmatically.

### Key Features of the DOM:
- **Dynamic Interaction**: The DOM allows JavaScript to interact with the browser, enabling dynamic updates to the content, structure, and style of a webpage without requiring a full reload.
- **Capabilities with JavaScript**:
    - Create, modify, and delete HTML elements dynamically.
    - Set or update styles, classes, and attributes of elements.
    - Add event listeners to respond to user interactions like clicks, keypresses, or mouse movements.
- **DOM Tree**:
    - The DOM tree is generated from an HTML document and represents the hierarchical structure of the document.
    - Each node corresponds to a part of the document (e.g., elements, attributes, text).

### Common DOM Methods and Properties:
- `document.querySelector()` - Select elements.
- `element.classList.add()` - Add a class to an element.
- `element.addEventListener()` - Attach event listeners.

Understanding and utilizing the DOM is fundamental for creating interactive and dynamic web applications.
